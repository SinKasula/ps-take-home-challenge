This repository is a take-home project. The project is to build a data-driven system for Mars Mission Control to predict Zeta Disease infection on the International Mars Colony.

<h3>What lies where</h3> 

<ul>Lib - Has a Jupyter notebook written in Python 3 that step by step explains each line of the Machine Learning Cycle</ul>
<ul>Input - Has the Train and Test data sets</ul>
<ul>Model - Has the saved Pipeline in a .pipe format</ul>
<ul>Output - Has the Test dataset with predictions</ul>


<h3>Software and Platform</h3>
Python 3.7.1

Jupyter 4.4.0


The packages I used to run the code in the book are listed in requirements.txt. 
To install the requirements using pip, run the following at the command-line:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Suggest to create a stand-alone virtual enironment for this project. 

Other Ways to run - via binder by clicking on lauch icon on top which creates an interactive notebook.
